# 攻略
## Drone Rooms
### Tessella (Frigate room)
Approach cache
Nergal: lancer(Strike>Spark) > Fogcasters > snarecasters > rest
retri: lancer(Strike>Spark>other)

### Tessera (Battlecruiser room)
Kite
Nergal gets aggro, stay outside of 10km until 1-2 are left
retribution into brawl range with gleam
Strike/Spark grippers or whichever swaps aggro to the retri > rest

### Overmind (Battleship room)
Spiral towards overmind
Sometimes the Overmind follows a NPC frigate, if that is the case, leave that frigate alive unless its a snare caster to keep the overmind close
Starving > Snarecaster > Spotlighter > rest while approaching > overmind once within range

## Triglavian Rooms
### Kikimora (Frig/Dessie room)
Kite initially
Put all reps on Nergal.
Kill order types: Damavik > Kiki(the one that switch target first) > others
Starving > Ghosting > Striking > Tangling
Notes:
Kite until damaviks dead, swap to kikis and go for the cache

### Vedmak (cruiser room)
Approach cache
Deacon control reps
Starving Damavik > Ghosting Damavik > Starving Vedmak > Harrowing Vedmak
Use drones+retri on one vedmak while Nergal spools on the other, kill kikis before Vedmaks

### Vila (Cruiser room)
Approach Cache
Renewing Damavik > Tangling Damavik > damaviks > vedmaks
Ignore the drones or use suppression towers to kill them

### Drekavac (Battlecruiser room)
Approach Cache
Starving Damavik > Starving Kikimora > rest of Kikimoras > Drekavacs
Sometime Drekavacs orbit a frigate, leave that frigate alive if so to keep them in close range

### Leshaks (Battleship room)
Approach Leshaks ASAP
Starving > Blinding > Renewing
Pay attenttion to how enemies move, make them move in the same direction and don't let them starburst
Renewing/Striking leshaks usually move in a group
Leshaks keep distance @ Tangling (12km), Starving (35km), rest (65km)

## Sleeper Rooms
### Lucid Sleepers (cruiser room)
Approach cache
Sentinel > Nullcharger > Firewatchers > Wardens

Ephialtes/Tyrannos (cruiser/extras room) Approach Cache
Dissipators/Nullchargers > Entanglers > Nergal on Tyrannos/retribution on rest
If there are no Tyrannos, retribution kill Ephialtes and nergal kills smaller ships

Notes:
careful with drone usage as they often swap to drones.

### Deepwatcher (Battleship room)
Grab cache and then Spiral Deepwatcher
Get Nergal spooling ASAP (occult ammo)
retribution+drones on one while nergal spools on another, heat when needed.

### Drifters Karybdis "Karen" Tyrannos (variants)
Spiral towards Karybdis
Avoid blue cloud!
Dissipators/Nullcharge > Entanglers/Entanglement > Illuminators > Karybdis > rest
Orbit Karybddis close, or try to guide her back towards the gate if she has moved too far away
if "Ephialtes Lancer" cruiser spawns, kill it last
Once in range of Karybdis (after neut pressure off), get spooling with Nergal, and use Retri+drones to kill other stuff

## Edencom Rooms
### Marshal
Approach
Avoid blue cloud!
if multiple Attack pacifiers, clear them out first
Pacifiers(Arrester>Drainer>marker) > Marshals > remaining enforcers
If a lot of frigate spawns, kite away to 65km+ from marshals while clearing them out, then reapproach marshals

## Pirates
### Sansha (Frigate/cruiser mix)
Kite initially
Heralds > Smiths > Lookouts > Fishers > rest
Ignore priests unless theres 4+, kill a few if so
Knights have bad tracking,spiral into them and use close range ammo; or kill them safely at range depending on time.

### Angels (frigate/cruiser mix)
Approach cache
Immediately put ALL reps on the nergal, both deacon+retribution
Make sure reactive is "reset" before moving in here
Lucifer Cynabal > Elite Lucifer Cynabal > rest
